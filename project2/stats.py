# stats.py
#
# Count and report statistics about the number of occurrences of
# words within some entered text.
#
# Usage: python3 stats.py
#
# This program processes a series of lines of text, looking for
# contiguous runs of alphabetic characters treating them each as a
# word. For each such word, it keeps a count of the number of its
# occurrences in the text.
#
# To end text entry hit RETURN and then CTRL-d.  It then reports a
# summary of the words it found, along with their counts.
#
# Alternative usage: python3 stats.py < textfile.txt
#
# The above instead processes the text of the file in 'textfile.txt'.
